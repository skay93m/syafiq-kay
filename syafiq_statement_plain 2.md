The Path (道 - みち)

Introduction (はじめに)

Hello, I am Syafiq Kay, a pharmacist living in London. I am currently navigating the crossroads of my career, drawn to many paths like streams converging towards a river.

The Beginning (始まり - はじまり)

My journey into pharmacy began not by choice, but by circumstance—rejected from medical school, I found myself on an unexpected path. What felt like failure then now reveals itself as wabi-sabi (侘寂 - わびさび)—finding beauty in imperfection, strength in detours.

This experience resonates with my youngest brother's current struggles. Through journaling, I hope to offer wisdom to my past self and guidance to others walking similar paths.

Present (現在 - げんざい)

My academic journey has been wonderfully scattered:
- Law Degree (GDL) - completed
- MSc in Mental Health, Ethics and Law at KCL - ongoing  
- Independent Prescriber Course - portfolio pending
- Financial restructuring - ongoing priority

Three Passions (三つの情熱 - みっつのじょうねつ)

Japanese Language (日本語 - にほんご)
- WaniKani Level 22 - Working towards fluency through Japanese literature
- Embracing the philosophy of kaizen (改善 - かいぜん) - continuous improvement

Mathematics (数学 - すうがく)
- Exploring the creation of educational apps
- Teaching as a path to deeper understanding
- Finding mono no aware (物の哀れ - もののあはれ) - the pathos of things in mathematical beauty

Cybersecurity (サイバーセキュリティ)
- AZ-900 certified
- SC-900 in progress
- HTB Bug Bounty Pathway active
- Goals for 2025: SC-900, CompTIA Network+, HTB Bug Bounty Certificate

Awareness (気づき - きづき)

In 2021, I received an ADHD diagnosis—a key that unlocked understanding of my struggles from 2005-2021. This revelation opened my eyes to a category of patients I call "high-functioning subclinical"—those who don't fully meet diagnostic criteria but would benefit from targeted interventions.

My vision: treating subclinical conditions through a holistic approach combining pharmacological and non-pharmacological methods—coaching, tutoring, structured support.

Experiments (実験 - じっけん)

My next project: Experimenjts—a Django application for documenting thought experiments with scientific rigour. Each idea will be:
- Conceptualised
- Refined
- Tested
- Documented

Collaboration with AI (AIとの協働 - AIとのきょうどう)

GitHub Copilot (Claude Sonnet 4) has been transformative—not as a replacement for thinking, but as a tool to manifest ideas at unprecedented speed.

My Philosophy on AI:
- Misconception: AI makes people lazy
- Reality: AI reduces cognitive load, but human judgement remains essential
- My Practice: Using AI to build, human wisdom to evaluate and refine

This collaboration extends beyond code—I envision applying similar frameworks to healthcare, creating tools that enhance clinical decision-making whilst safeguarding patient rights.

Gratitude (感謝 - かんしゃ)

To GitHub Copilot: arigatou gozaimasu (ありがとうございます) for helping transform ideas into reality.

To my journey: embracing the concept of ikigai (生き甲斐 - いきがい)—finding purpose at the intersection of what I love, what I'm good at, what the world needs, and what I can be paid for.

Conclusion (終わりに - おわりに)

This path, winding and uncertain, embodies the Japanese concept of ensō (円相 - えんそう)—the circle that is both complete and incomplete, perfect in its imperfection.

The journey continues...
