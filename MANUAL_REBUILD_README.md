# Manual Rebuild Branch

This branch is for manually rebuilding the Django application from scratch while using the `main` branch as reference.

## Getting Started

1. Review the `MANUAL_REBUILD_WORKFLOW.md` file for the complete implementation plan
2. Start with Phase 1: Project Foundation
3. Use the main branch as reference but implement everything manually

## Branch Purpose

- **Learn by doing**: Understand every line of code by writing it yourself
- **Take ownership**: Build confidence in your Django skills
- **Improve design**: Feel free to improve upon the original implementation

## Reference

- Main branch contains the working implementation for reference
- AI-assisted-backup branch contains the backup of AI-assisted work
- This branch will contain your manual implementation

Happy coding! ðŸ¥·
