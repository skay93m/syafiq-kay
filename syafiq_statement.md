# 道 (Dō) - The Path

## はじめに (Introduction)

Hello, I am **Syafiq Kay** (シャフィク・ケイ), a pharmacist living in London. I am currently navigating the crossroads of my career, drawn to many paths like streams converging toward a river.

---

## 始まり (The Beginning)

My journey into pharmacy began not by choice, but by circumstance—rejected from medical school, I found myself on an unexpected path. What felt like failure then now reveals itself as *wabi-sabi*—finding beauty in imperfection, strength in detours.

This experience resonates with my youngest brother's current struggles. Through journaling, I hope to offer wisdom to my past self and guidance to others walking similar paths.

## 気づき (Awareness)

In 2021, I received an ADHD diagnosis—a key that unlocked understanding of my struggles from 2005-2021. This revelation opened my eyes to a category of patients I call **"high-functioning subclinical"**—those who don't fully meet diagnostic criteria but would benefit from targeted interventions.

My vision: treating subclinical conditions through a holistic approach combining pharmacological and non-pharmacological methods—coaching, tutoring, structured support.

## 実験 (Experiments)

My next project: **Experimenjts** (実験)—a Django application for documenting thought experiments with scientific rigor. Each idea will be:
- Conceptualized
- Refined
- Tested
- Documented

---

## AIとの協働 (Collaboration with AI)

**GitHub Copilot** (Claude Sonnet 4) has been transformative—not as a replacement for thinking, but as a tool to manifest ideas at unprecedented speed.

### My Philosophy on AI:
- **Misconception**: AI makes people lazy
- **Reality**: AI reduces cognitive load, but human judgment remains essential
- **My Practice**: Using AI to build, human wisdom to evaluate and refine

This collaboration extends beyond code—I envision applying similar frameworks to healthcare, creating tools that enhance clinical decision-making while safeguarding patient rights.

## 感謝 (Gratitude)

To GitHub Copilot: *arigatou gozaimasu* for helping transform ideas into reality.

To my journey: embracing the concept of *ikigai*—finding purpose at the intersection of what I love, what I'm good at, what the world needs, and what I can be paid for.

---

## 終わりに (Conclusion)

This path, winding and uncertain, embodies the Japanese concept of *ensō*—the circle that is both complete and incomplete, perfect in its imperfection.

The journey continues...
