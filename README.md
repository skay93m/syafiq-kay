## Getting Started

1. **Review Documentation**: Start with `docs/DJANGO_REBUILD_MANUAL.md` for concepts and `docs/MANUAL_REBUILD_WORKFLOW.md` for the implementation plan
2. **Study Style Guide**: Review `docs/STYLE_GUIDE.md` for coding standards and naming conventions to follow
3. **Clean Slate**: Run `scripts/clean_project.sh` to remove existing Django code (optional)
4. **Create GitHub Issue**: Use `docs/GITHUB_ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md` to track your progress
5. **Begin Phase 1**: Start with Project Foundation as outlined in the workflow
6. **Use Reference**: Check the main branch when you need guidance

## Branch Purpose

- **Learn by doing**: Understand every line of code by writing it yourself
- **Take ownership**: Build confidence in your Django skills
- **Improve design**: Feel free to improve upon the original implementation

## Reference

- Main branch contains the working implementation for reference
- AI-assisted-backup branch contains the backup of AI-assisted work
- This branch will contain your manual implementation
